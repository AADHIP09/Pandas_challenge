# Pandas_challenge

## NOTE TO Grader: THIS CHALLENGE IS INCOMPLETE AS I ENCOUNTERED SOME ISSUES WHILE CREATING MY SECOND DATA FRAME ## 

I have calculated all the values, but I'm unable to present them in a single data frame.

#I am trying to use the above code to create the data frame but it keeps giving me the error 
     **##ERROR MESSAGE: *ValueError: cannot reindex on an axis with duplicate labels*##**

## SINCE I AM UNABLE TO GENERATE THE SCHOOL SUMMARY DATA FRAME, I AM UNABLE TO DO THE BELOW: 
    #Scores by School Spending (5 points)
    #Scores by School Size (5 points)
    #Scores by School Type (5 points)
    #Written Report (15 points)

# WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE SOME FEEDBACK ON WHY MY CODE IS NOT WORKING - I AM UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I'M DOING WRONG #
## THE SAME LOGIC WORKED BELOW WHEN I CREATED DATA FRAME FOR SCORES BY GRADE FOR EACH SUBJECT ##
